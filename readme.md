> 64-bit processor used within my bachelor thesis.

RISC63 is a **purely 64-bit RISC processor** with basic pipelining described in VHDL. It is a prototype of a carefully crafted [RISC64 architecture](https://github.com/dominiksalvet/risc64) and its main purpose is to demonstrate the RISC64 abilities. To truly achieve that, the whole RISC63 has been designed in a simple manner. Convince yourself â€” look around.

Since RISC63 is a prototype, it does not implement all RISC64 features. Nevertheless, the following implemented features indicate that RISC63 itself is an unconvetional processor architecture, which has something to offer:

* All instructions are 16 bits wide
* Only the most used instructions are present
* 16 x 64-bit general purpose registers
* Only aligned 64-bit memory transfers are supported
* Efficient PC-relative addressing

> 64-bit processor used within my bachelor thesis.

RISC63 is a **purely 64-bit RISC processor** with pipelining described in VHDL. It is the prototype of a carefully crafted [RISC64 architecture](https://github.com/dominiksalvet/risc64) and its main purpose is to demonstrate the RISC64 abilities. To truly achieve that, the whole RISC63 has been designed in a simple manner. Convince yourself â€” look around.

Since RISC63 is a prototype, it does not implement all RISC64 features. Nevertheless, the following implemented features indicate that RISC63 itself is an unconvetional processor architecture, which has something to offer:

* 16-bit instructions
* 64-bit loads and stores
* Byte-addressable address space
* 16 x 64-bit registers
* All registers are equal
* 2 operand instructions
* Native `mv` instruction
* PC-relative addressing
* Native immediate offsets
* Reverse instruction variants
* One register write per instruction
* Control registers

> 64-bit processor used within my bachelor thesis.

RISC63 is the processor prototype of the custom [RISC64 architecture](https://github.com/dominiksalvet/risc64). It is a **purely 64-bit RISC processor** with pipelining described in VHDL. Being built on such an unconventional processor architecture, it features the following traits:

* 16-bit instructions
* 64-bit loads and stores
* Byte-addressable address space
* 16 x 64-bit registers
* All registers are equal
* 2 operand instructions
* Native `mv` instruction
* PC-relative addressing
* Native immediate offsets
* Reverse instruction variants
* One register write per instruction
* Control registers

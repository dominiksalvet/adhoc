# Decoding of Instructions

This file describes the exact decoding of RISC63 instructions and control registers indexes. That may be useful for programming RISC63 in machine code as well as for creating low level tools such as assembler.

> If you would rather see instructions behavior, please take a look at the [instructions.md](instructions.md) file.
